# YAR : Yet Another Rust OS
Yes that's right it's Yet Another Rust Operating System and unlike the operating systems like Windows, Linux or Mac which offer their own unique flavor this OS offers nothing. In fact it is less than nothing! it does not even have a working terminal yet so good luck trying to get it to do anything useful!
